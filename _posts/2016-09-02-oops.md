  A Web security company's systems are offline this morning after an apparent
  intrusion into the company's network. The servers and routers of Staminus
  Communications-a Newport Beach, California-based hosting and distributed
  denial of service (DDoS) protection company-went offline at 8am Eastern Time
  on Thursday in what a representative described in a Twitter post as "a rare
  event [that] cascaded across multiple routers in a system wide event, making
  our backbone unavailable."
